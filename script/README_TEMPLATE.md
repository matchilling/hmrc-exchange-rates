## ðŸ’· Details

You should use these exchanges rates if you have to convert any foreign currency to sterling for customs and VAT purposes.

The EU rate includes the following countries:

- Austria
- Belgium
- Cyprus
- Estonia
- Finland
- France
- Germany
- Greece
- Ireland
- Italy
- Latvia
- Lithuania
- Luxembourg
- Malta
- Netherlands
- Portugal
- Slovakia
- Slovenia
- Spain

You should only use the EU rate for conversion of invoices drawn in the euro. Do not confuse it with the euro rate
published for agricultural levy purposes or the bit error rate (BER) daily rate set to help payment of taxes in the euro.

## ðŸ›  CSV and XML converter

HMRC publishes new monthly exchange rates in [CSV][hmrc-url] and [XML][hmrc-url] format on its website during
the last week of the month. The CSV version is usually a few days before the XML one available.

Unfortunately only the XML version can be retrieved programmatically as the URI to CSV contains a unique file descriptor
which obviously can not be predicted. Therefore the XML converter is being used by default.

However, you can always manually add new rates to this repository using [this CSV converter](./script/converter/from_csv.sh).

```sh
$ curl --silent https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/api/v2/exchange_rates/files/monthly_csv_2023-11.csv | \
    ./script/converter/from_csv.sh \
    > rate/2023/11.json
```
